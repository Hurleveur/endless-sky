Most of your shots miss, but because he cannot shoot back and you are well protected anyway, you can take the time to aim precisely. You manage to shoot his arm and he drops his pistol. He does not shout at all when getting shot, simply sits on the ground on that position, showing he surrenders. You get out of your cover and grab the other pistol. "You can keep them; you've earned it. This was a fair fight, Captain! I'd like to try again some time, and maybe get my pistols back..."
