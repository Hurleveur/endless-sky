			`	In his hands he is holding a piece of foil paper. You recognize it as the wrapper from one of the food rations that you have been transporting to the Unfettered, the "tribute" that they demand from the peaceful Hai. But having never unwrapped one of the rations, you had not realized that there is writing on the inside, a few words in the angular alphabet of the Hai. The Unfettered youth sees your look of confusion, and translates the message. "It says, 'Hai-home is your home too. Rejoin your people.'"`

	description "This sensor-laden exploration vessel hails back to a more peaceful era of the Hai. Though they have no true ramscoop, a technology the Hai never developed, their built-in collection gills magnify the natural ramscoop present in all ships. These expensive features are the reason the ship has been replaced with the Lightning Bug."
	description "However, this ship is very useful as an agile cargo hauler, able to defend itself in small skirmishes and bring cargo to long distances. However you suspect that it does not operate at its full potential, as if it stayed in the ocean too long... Still, this ship is clearly proof of the durability of Hai technology."

It is appropriate for bringing this important food cargo safely to destination, and defend yourself if need be."`
			`	"This is a mighty relic of the past, from the times our Empire used to control the stars; a Ladybug. Of course, it has some... drawbacks, compared to how it was in its glory, and don't expect the best price in a shipyard. Nevertheless it is a fine vessel, capable of taking a respectable amount of cargo across large distances, and to protect it well enough as well! So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime, as they simply don't make ships like these anymore!"`

Worry not, we will make it something of no consequence, like an old Korath forbidden tech you would not have known about, that we had to confiscate." You quickly realize they are not asking you for your opinion at all. In fact, you notice the fine has already been issued before you could say anything. "Oh, and you should not change its colours, you'll understand why later."`
