#TODO after this:
#get missions to add Shield Beetle to darkcloak
#get missions to add new rifles, bringing back all kinds of guns
#get missions to help pirates annoying the Hai, by bringing them tech

# the korath prisoners helps you make coolers, and help against the Kor later, the alphas were using them to get intel on jump drives and how to make them + most importantly on the Kor to prepare for their Kor Sestor assault.

#start of wanderer war : young captain just became warlord and wants to see if you are rd for a fight, doesn't want you to get killed fighting the Wanderers, need to wait for intro to be merged
