As such, they have wasted time designing a ship for the sole purpose of transporting goods in great quantity : the Geocoris. Or at least that is how it seemed to us at first, it now seems like such a design is... interesting. It is pretty much garanteed there will be one such ship at all times in their home system, Ya-Hai, the center of their trade.

"""
-Also they will have questions about the carriers of the republic, caus they saw the gift bringer (wont tell u why though) do a detailed scan of that carrier when it comes to bring jd (conversation+they will turn hostile?)

-if at war with hai : steal a geocoris that is near <hai world> GENERIC? For big payment

-the unfettered wanna know about the quarg and if they could be persuaded to change side/will intervene at any point if they take hai worlds/use jd agressively

-if you have nerve gas, they will ask you to get more of it for them to do tests with it, if you do they will mass produce it

-GENERIC(for all hai worlds big reward at the end): pretend to bring food from hai world (small quantity) you will also (set up some listening equipment/steal smth/learn about their shipyards/?) There is a chance they find out each time, dropping rep and at the end causes war, after a warning

-GENERIC: bring back a jd that is hidden on <pirate world>

-mission + GENERIC: bring back materials to build new ships from <human metal producer/pirate world>

---------THEY TRUST YOU NOW-----------

-add access to shield beetle on their homeworld, the unfettered have designed a new ion weapon, go test it out in combat (now that you have SB) against this isolated fleet of hai (in their space if you are hostile to hai otherwise behind ennemy lines ?)

-go find a way to help pirates so they distract the hai better, find out where they are + bring tech


-they want you to get wanderer weapons by boarding them so they can counter them better (they inform you that more point defence and shields would be good for now and start working on a new cooler, and keep using long range)

-the unfettered have designed a new fighter design they wanna test, destroy a swarm of them if you can ! They will use the combat data to improve their shield matrixes a bit (not used to do them for such small ships)

-help in the attack of a wanderer world,  when enough jd brought

-scout the large Hai fleet

-GENERIC : steal and bring back wanderer ships (once one wanderer orld is conquered)

-they have a new carrier ship design they wanna test, inspired from geocoris and carrier,  that uses the previous fighters, escort 3 of those to take a wanderer world

-learn more about those pesky 2 pugs ships protecting the weak wanderers/disable them if you have the strenght to do so, they ask you about those ships and arent too eager to fight them too much

----------------------PEACE?-----------------------

-after negociating for tribute "escort" the deep rivers bringing food to their worlds until they enter the system then ambush them if you want, if you do the unfettered will assist you and the war will continue, but the pug will intervene more

-if you attacked those, take another  wanderer worlds on the path to the homeworld

-attack the wanderer homeworld (but the pugs take it back after you take it and the unfettered make peace with wanderer for good)

-wanna know about the kor bots

-to continue ; turn their attention back towards hai to beat them now that they have more ressources
