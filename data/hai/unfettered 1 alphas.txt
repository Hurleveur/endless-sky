			`Mera is expecting you, and comes to your ship right away. She is eager to give you the intel, which will hopefully help you find the Auxiliary. "I am glad you came so fast! But don't worry: that Auxiliary can't go very far before some serious repairs - not with the kind of damage it suffered anyway." She seems somewhere else, as if disturbed by something.`
			choice
				`	"Get to the point. Where can I find it?"`

					goto damage
				`	"How could I capture such a ship, with so many defending it?"`
					goto capture
			`	You seem to have stressed her a bit. "Are you always in a rush?" she asks. "Just look for traces of these particles; it should lead you to them. Based on chemical composition, these particles seem to be coming from the jump drive - it must be malfunctioning, but I have no idea in what way it is. This Auxiliary is no joke - it has room for over 100 crew members, so be sure to have what it takes to capture it. You could always disable it and then come back later to board them; but in that case, make sure to be quick, or else the Alphas could repair it." You remember it also had fighters accompanying it.`
				goto agree
			label capture
				`	She takes a while to answer, "We never focused too much on capturing ships at any cost, preferring to see the enemy eye to eye and only stun them, so they may live to fight another day but I am sure you humans may have... alternative approaches. Their base is probably isolated, so you could always disable them and come back later with a different ship, or just outfit the one you have differently."`
			choice
				`	"What about the damage on their ship? How is that relevant to my mission?"`
					goto information
				`	"Can you tell me more about what kind of damage it was, on their ship?"`
			label damage
			`	"The damage was done by some kind of beam weapon, and a very strong one at that. It looks like it only got partially deflected by the shields, if at all. I wonder what kind of weapon can do that." She looks intrigued, and pauses to think about it, then continues, "That would explain why it's forbidden for us to venture east with jump drives. We lack any hull repair capabilities, and to be honest with you, our hull is not much more resilient than the one of some human ships, like that Auxiliary."`
			choice
				`	"They seemed to be using the same weapon against me."`
					goto logs
				`	"What can we use that information for?"`
					goto information
			label logs
			`	"Yes, I noticed on the scanner logs. I would advise not relying too heavily on your shields, but they don't seem to have that many of those weapons, so you should be fine. I do not believe they could have designed such weapons by themselves. They probably just stole them from nearby aliens."`
			choice
				`	"What about the damage on their ship? How is that relevant to my mission?"`
					goto information
				`	"You should have asked me to do an outfit scan, earlier."`
			`	"Maybe, but it could have provoked them further. They apparently like their secrets. I only wanted to know about the structure of the ship, but I'd agree that knowing more about those weapons would be useful. Now, back to the damage on their ship.`
			label information
			`	"Obviously, this amount of damage has consequences. It looks like they've quickly patched it up, so it won't affect their hull resistance to weapon's fire. However, this is interesting," she says, pointing out particles on her pad you have not seen before. "Another captain found weird particles in that same system. We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and antimatter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contacting matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?`
			`	"It doesn't matter much anyway. I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and is only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only the Quarg and Korath have a similar level of technology, and those are the races that are rumoured to have invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`
			label agree
			`	You were ready to go, but she seems to have something more to say. "Oh, and one last thing before you leave: the base is probably far away, so I would advise taking some fuel pods, especially considering the damage left on the Auxiliary means you will probably not have much time to wait to fuel up from the local stars either, and you should be ready to jump between systems as fast as possible. Also, be prepared for a fight in space, as well as within the ship itself, to claim it."`

The Korath did not always raid us, there was a time of peace. That peace ended when they asked for our help in their war, and we declined... Now, like then, these ones need our help.

They could be hidden, so you proceed cautiously, looking for the jump drive vault. On the way you hear sounds - sounds that definitely did not originate from humans. Heading that way, you find a brig full of Korath slaves, with a lizard head displayed above the cells. They seem to have been prisoners of the Alphas, and you find what appears to be a crudely rigged translation device with them. They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably take them to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then. You notice one has a very serious injury to his leg, it seems part of it has been replaced by a crude prosthetic. He may not survive the transport.`

The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive code, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information. Going deeper into these recent logs of activities, you find a monkey symbol, with an eye. But it is not all, there is a symbol of a crossed portal, with a red skull icon.`
