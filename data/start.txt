	description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
	description `	After receiving the license and with freedom from this planet at your fingertips, you travel to the bank to take out a loan on your first ship...`

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 434,000 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`This world is like nothing you have ever seen before, so much so in fact that you wonder if you are ready...`
	`	You head for the shipyard, excited to see what ships they have in store, and decide that this "Aphid" would suit your needs.`
	`	That is, except if you decide to get adventurous and try out the impetious Lightning Bug. The ship may be able to beat human medium warships if a competent pilot is at the helm...`
	`	Pirates are not far from here, after all, may as well be safe... No way to know how soon you could find yourself in a fight with them...`

	scene "scene/lobby"
	`	You head to the bank's lobby, hoping to get enough money to be able to buy one of these pristine ships.`
	`	However, after looking at the prices it is clear the only ship you can get is an Aphid. You loan as much money as you need in order to buy one, in what has to be the first seriously unwise act of your life. The contract stipulates you give all of your credits to the bank, as a guarantee in order to get enough of a loan. You will probably have to sell some part of the default ship in order to be able to afford flying it!`
	`	The bank employee sums it up to you, with a hesitant smile. "This will put you in a debt of 1431 thousand credits, due in the course of 2 years, with interest rate of 0.3% per day. Please sign here." You did not head all the way into Hai space to have doubts now.`
	name
	`	You head out of the bank, preparing yourself to buy the Aphid, but you see a notice in the shipyard. A retiring captain of this Hai specie offers to sell some of his ships at an interesting price, including a Grasshopper... You could always go to the spaceport to see what he can offer you, or you could buy the Aphid now. The choice is yours.`

		`	(Go to the shipyard.)`

	`	You go find the captain that offers to sell the Grasshopper, and thankfully they did not yet sell it.`
	`	"Hello, good fellow! I assume you come for the Grasshopper."`
	choice
		`	"Yes indeed."`
		`	"How did you know?"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	"I can see the will to explore in your eyes. I would be delighted to have you fly the 'Pristine Jewel'!" They say, taking you to the ship. It is not brand new, but it still looks in surprisingly good condition.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai grasshopper"
	`	Because I like you I'll give you a friendly price, what do you say about 1.4 millions for this wonderful ship? That's about half of the price you would have to pay if you were to buy it in a shipyard."`
	choice
		`	"Sold!"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`

	`	They take the time to explain why the ship is so marvelous but you are not listening anymore, because of how excited you are to get into that ship.`
