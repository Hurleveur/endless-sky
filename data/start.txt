	description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
	description `	After receiving the license and with freedom from this planet at your fingertips, you travel to the bank to take out a loan on your first ship...`

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 434,000 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	description `You grew up on Greenwater, a world with a very rich culture, mostly thanks to space travel. You've dreamed of owning your own fleet since you were given toys spaceships to play with, at a very young age. You worked in a texture farm there, making human quite clothing that surprisingly sold very well.`
	description `	Here, there is no need for licenses in order to buy or fly your ship.`
	description `	A lot has happened whilst you were on the planet, and you feel like it is finally time for you to play your part.`

	`	You know it is the same world, but you've never been to the shipyard before, and it feels like traveling already. You wonder if you are ready to take the big leap... You've seen pictures of ships before, but seeing them for real is something else entirely. You are stunned by how new and shiny they look, even though you know a lot of those ships have been in service for long years.`
	`	This "Aphid" could suit your needs. Fast, and able to carry a respectable amount of cargo.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai aphid"
	`	That is, except if you want to get adventurous and try out the impetious Grasshopper. Surely the interceptor would be able to beat human small warships prodided a competent pilot is at the helm...`
	`	You have heard tales of pirates and quick money... Indeed, north of here there are even Hai pirates, that call themselves the 'Unfettered'. Maybe they could come to like you, if you were to show them strength...`
	choice
		`	(Go to the bank.)`
	scene "scene/hai bank"
	`	You head to the bank's lobby, hoping to get enough money to be able to buy one of these pristine ships.`
	`	To your disapointment the only ship you could afford is an Aphid. You arrange the contract to loan as much money as you need in order to buy one, in what has to be the first seriously unwise act of your life. You will probably have to sell some part of the ship in order to be able to afford flying it!`
	`	You can probably sell the shield regenerator without any consequences, so long as you do not get too close to hostile territory, you may even downgrade the anti-missile turret.`
	`	The bank employee sums it up to you, with a hesitant smile. "This will put you in a debt of 1 million 431 thousand credits, due in the course of 2 years, with an interest rate of 0.3% per day. Please sign here."`
	name
	`	You head out of the bank, preparing yourself to buy the Aphid, but on the way you see a notice. A retiring captain of this Hai specie offers to sell some of his ships at an interesting price, including a Grasshopper... Maybe they could sell it to you for a fair price.`
	choice
		`	(Go to the shipyard.)`
			decline
		`	(Go see what the captain has to offer first.)`
	`	You head to the spaceport and easily the captain that offers to sell the Grasshopper. Thankfully they did not yet sell it, now is your chance.`
	`	They see you arrive and greet you in Hai. You somehow never really learned the language, even after spending quite a bit of time with them, probably due to the fact they all speak yours. Seeing you do not understand they switch to your language. "Hello, good fellow! I assume you come for the Grasshopper." Your interest for this ship must be apparent.`
	choice
		`	"Yes indeed."`
		`	"How did you know?"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	"I can see the will to explore in your eyes. I would be delighted to have you flying the 'Pristine Jewel' !" They say, taking you to the ship. It is not brand new, but it still looks in surprisingly good condition.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai grasshopper"
	`	"Because I like you I'll give you a friendly price, what do you say about 1.4 millions for this wonderful ship? That's about half of the price you would have to pay if you were to buy it in a shipyard."`
	choice
		`	"Sold!"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	They take the time to explain why the ship is so marvelous but you are not listening anymore, because of how excited you are to get into that ship.`
